 An `AWFMapStrategy` object provides a common interface between a specific map SDK and the application. This object
 is responsible for determining how to add and remove overlay and annotation objects on the map, as well as providing other
 basic information about the state of its internal map view, such as bounding coordinates, zoom level, etc.
 
 The base implementation of this class doesn't do anything and should be subclassed for each supported map SDK. Subclasses should
 override the methods to manage adding and removing overlays and annotations from the map.
 
 This object must remain the primary delegate of its internal map view regardless of map SDK since it manages all overlays. However,
 the same map delegates for the specific map SDK are also forwarded to the `mapViewDelegate` object when assigned.
