/**
 The `AWFWeatherMapDelegate` protocol defines a set of optional methods that you can use to receive messages related
 to updates or changes to the weather map.
 
 This protocol does not receive the standard map view delegate messages that are provided with the specific mapping SDK the 
 associated weather map uses (e.g., `MKMapViewDelegate` for Apple's MapKit). To receive these messages specific to the
 selected mapping SDK, assign your delegate to the {@link AWFWeatherMap#mapViewDelegate mapViewDelegate} property on 
 your `AWFWeatherMap` instance.
